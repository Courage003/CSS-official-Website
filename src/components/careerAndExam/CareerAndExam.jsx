        <p className="mx-8 sm:mx-20 py-8  lg:text-lg ">
          The civil services in India are the lifeblood of the nation's
          administration. These dedicated, non-elected officials form a vast
          network, stretching from the heart of the government in New Delhi to
          the far corners of India's diverse districts. They play a crucial role
          in keeping the country running, from formulating national policies to
          ensuring their effective implementation on the ground. <br />A career
          in the civil services holds immense appeal for many Indians. It offers
          prestige, stability, and the chance to make a real difference in the
          lives of millions. However, securing a coveted position in this highly
          competitive field is no easy feat. Aspiring civil servants must
          conquer the rigorous Civil Services Examination (CSE) conducted by the
          Union Public Service Commission (UPSC). This multi-stage exam, known
          for its difficulty, attracts thousands of applicants each year.

          The Civil Services Examination (CSE) conducted by the UPSC is a
          multi-stage process, testing various competencies of aspiring civil
          servants. Here's a breakdown of both the exam pattern and syllabus:{" "}

                This serves as a screening test, with two objective-type papers.
                The first focuses on general knowledge like Indian history,
                politics, and current affairs. The second (CSAT) tests your
                aptitude, including comprehension and reasoning. Qualifying the
                Prelims is mandatory to proceed further.

                A series of written papers delving deeper into various subjects.

                choice. Language skills are also tested. Your performance in the
